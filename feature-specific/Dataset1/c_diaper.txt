diapers  $ pos $  It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside. but  The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.

Diaper Champ  $ pos $  The Diaper Champ is the best we found! but  I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.

convenient  $ pos $  it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills. but  My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.

garbage bags  $ pos $  1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills. but  The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.

container  $ pos $  The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby. but  This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.

fill  $ pos $  It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store? but  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
