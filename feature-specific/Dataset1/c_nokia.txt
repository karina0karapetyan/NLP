signal quality  $ pos $  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .  but  i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
