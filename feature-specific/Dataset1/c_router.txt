power  $ pos $  But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits. but  The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.

looked  $ pos $  The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA. but  Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.

costs  $ pos $  So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. but  Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.

motor  $ pos $  Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price but  I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.

start  $ pos $  The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation. but  It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.

guide  $ pos $  The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate. but  Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping

adjustment  $ pos $  The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy. but  It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.

heavy  $ pos $  It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use. but  The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.

operate  $ pos $  UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table. but  It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.

switch  $ pos $  Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand. but  I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.

price  $ pos $  Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain. but  The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.

use  $ pos $  I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances. but  The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.

starts  $ pos $  I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly. but  The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.

price  $ pos $  Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy. but  The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
